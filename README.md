> *Sebuah lirik lagu untuk akhir tahun tentang apa yang hilang dan apa yang tersisa.*

### I. The Disconnect
Stumbled 'round the block a thousand times  
You missed every call that I had tried  
So now I'm giving up  
A heartbreak in mid-December  
You don't give a fuck  
You'd never remember me  

While you're pulling on his jeans  
Getting lost in the big city  
I was looking out our window  
Watching all the cars go  
Wondering if I'll see Chicago  
Or a sunset on the west coast  
Or will I die in the cold?  
Feeling blue and alone  
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo  

### II. The Regret (Chorus)
> **I hope you get your ballroom floor** > **Your perfect house with rose red doors** > **I'm the last thing you'd remember** > **It's been a long, lonely December** > **I wish I'd known that less is more** > **But I was passed out on the floor** > **And that's the last thing I remember** > **It's been a long, lonely December**

### III. The Confession
Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light  
I came out grieving, barely breathing, and you came out alright  
But I'm sure you'll take his hand  
I hope he's better than I ever could've been  
My mistakes were not intentions  
This is a list of my confessions I couldn't say  
Pain is never permanent, but tonight it's killing me  

### IV. The Echo (Outro)
*I miss your face, you're in my head* *There's so many things that I should've said* *A year of suffering, a lesson learned* I hope you get your ballroom floor  
Your perfect house with rose red doors  
I'm the last thing you'd remember  
It's been a long, lonely December  
I wish I'd known that less is more  
But I was passed out on the floor  
And that's the last thing I remember  
It's been a long, lonely December
